#SQL-Advent-Challenge

**Author**: Anjani Upadhyay

**Duration**: 24 days

**Source**: InterviewMaster.AI – SQL Advent Calendar


This repository contains my solutions to a 24 day SQL challenge designed to strengthen practical SQL skills through daily, progressively complex problems. The challenge covered a wide range of real world query patterns commonly tested in data analyst and analytics engineering interviews. Rather than focusing on “perfect” answers, this project reflects my consistent practice by breaking down the complex logic into solvable parts and iteratively improving over the month of December 2025.

### Key Questions Explored:

* How do you extract meaningful insights from relational data?
* How can complex business logic be translated into clear SQL queries?
* What is the most readable and efficient way to solve aggregation and filtering problems?
* How can window functions simplify analytical use cases?

### What I Practised:

1. **Filtering & Aggregation** - WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING
2. **Joins** - inner, left, multi table joins
3. **Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
4. **Window functions** - ROW_NUMBER, ROWS_BETWEEN, RANK, LAG, LEAD
5. **Date & String functions**
6. **Query optimization & readability**
